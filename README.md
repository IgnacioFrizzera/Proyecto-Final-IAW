# Las Olivas Backoffice
This was a project for a college subject called Web Applications Engineering, and now serves as a backoffice for Las Olivas, a local clothing shop from my hometown. It's developed in Laravel and deployed in AWS, where I had to use services such as EC2 and Route 53.

This project was one of the first ones where I solved a real world problematic and worked along with the Las Olivas staff to find out how to solve their needs.

## Disclaimer
Most of the code is in english, but there's a mix of english and spanish in commits.
